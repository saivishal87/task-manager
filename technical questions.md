# Answers to Technical Questions

## 1. How long did you spend on the coding test?

The coding test took me almost a day to complete. I would divide the time dedicated into three-reading the problem, actually implementing the solution, and then some testing to ensure that it was functional in the way needed. In this scenario, I had to implement the design of a task management application, allowing for such functionality as adding tasks, deleting, updates, search, and filtering.

## 2. What was the most useful feature that was added to the latest version of your chosen language? Please include a snippet of code that shows how you've used it.

Out of all new features integrated in **JavaScript**'s latest version, ES2023, the most useful of them is the Logical Assignment Operators. These operators are used to combine logics with the assignment. All these have been represented by `&&`, `||`, and `??`. They lead to more concise and readable code on one hand and bring better performance on the other side. Logically, with the introduction of such operators developers did not have to write extra conditions for checking assignment operations beforehand. Instead of that, with the help of these logical assignment operators, they will be able to obtain the same result in more clean syntax.

### Logical Assignment Operators:
These operators perform a logical operation on a value before assigning it:

1. **Logical AND Assignment (`&&=`)**: If the value is truthy, the left-hand side will be updated. The assignment won't happen if the left-hand value is falsy (like `null`, `undefined` or `false`)

2. **Logical OR Assignment (`||=`)**: The right-hand value will be assigned to the left-hand side if the left-hand side value is falsy. An example of such would be a value like `null`, `undefined`, `false`, `0`, `NaN`, or an empty string.

3. **Logical Nullish Assignment (`??=`)**: It assigns the right-hand side value to the left-hand side if the left-hand side is `null` or `undefined`.

These types of operators are eliminating many lines of boilerplate code and making default assignment to a variable much easier while conditionally updating a variable.

### Example of Using the `&&=` Operator:
In my **task management application**, I used the **Logical AND Assignment (`&&=`)** operator to manage task priorities more efficiently.

Here we might want to set a default priority (e.g., `'Medium'`) only if the task does not already have a priority defined. Before I would have needed to write an `if` statement like this checking that the priority is undefined before assigning the default, but with `&&=` it is much more concise:.

### Code Snippet:

   ```javascript
        let taskPriority = undefined;

        // Using the logical AND assignment (&&=) operator
        taskPriority &&= 'Medium'; // Only assigns 'Medium' if taskPriority is not null or undefined

        console.log(taskPriority); // Output will be 'Medium' if taskPriority was undefined or null

        // If taskPriority is truthy, it will remain unchanged
        taskPriority = 'High';
        taskPriority &&= 'Medium'; // This will NOT change taskPriority as 'High' is truthy

        console.log(taskPriority); // Output will still be 'High'
```

## 3. How would you track down a performance issue in production? Have you ever had to do this?

While it has not been possible for me to yet track down a performance issue in a production environment, I hold a lucid notion of the standard approaches on how diagnosis and resolution of such issues are undertaken.


If, however, I would have to deal with a performance problem, these are the steps I would take:

- **Optimizing Code and Resources**: When no trouble is found, I can direct the optimization of the right code or resource. This may involve code rewrites in non-optimal forms, better-performing database queries, or enabling caching just to save load time.

- **Testing Changes**: In conjunction with changes into the product, I would proceed to perform a through test of the application to test, alongside performance improvement, whether any new problems have been introduced.

- **Monitoring and Logging**: 
My first step would have been to ensure that substantial monitoring and logging systems are properly employed. 
The use of APM applications to collect response time, error rates, and resource usage data would be performed. This should provide an insight into any unusual behavior identified through logging.

- **Constant Monitoring**: Finally, I would like to establish continuous monitoring to make sure stationary improvement on performance, as well as to address energement in any other result the future may afford

## 4. If you had more time, what additional features or improvements would you consider adding to the task management application?

If I had more time, I would consider adding the following features and improvements to the task management application:

1. **User Authentication**: JWT / OAuth user authentication will be added with proper security measures where the user can save his tasks and accordingly access them from anywhere.
2. **Task Categories**: Tasks can be categorized, for example, Work, Personal, or Shopping, so that the user can manage his tasks better.
3. **Task Reminders**: A service for push notifications or email reminders should be provided to inform the user about the approaching deadline of his tasks.
4. **Drag-and-drop Interface**: Allow task drag and drop functionalities using priority or deadline-based drag-and-drop tasks.
5. **Task Comments**: Allow users to add comments or notes to their tasks, which collaborate better.
6. **Dark Mode**: Include dark mode for users who like the interface to look more futuristic.
7. **Task Sharing**: Allow users to share tasks with others, thus promoting collaborative management of tasks.
8. **Analytics Dashboard**: Provide users with a dashboard to show their completion rates of their tasks, how many are overdue, and what else in terms of productivity statistic

These features would make the application more functional, user-friendly, and suitable for team-based collaboration.
